            <h1>About The Tool</h1>

            <p>
              The Arizona Voting Location Siting Tool aids election officials in the siting process by producing optimal voting locations and ballot drop boxes for half-mile grid squares across a county. Election officials are able to find specific locations for consideration in these areas using local knowledge of their county’s resources and needs. The Siting Tool also provides visualization of demographic and voter data at the community level in each of the state’s eleven most populous counties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, the Voting Location Siting Tool provides location modeling for vote centers (7 day and 13 day) and drop boxes in Maricopa County. Additionally, the Tool now provides modeling for voting locations in the rest of Arizona’s most populous counties.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note: The Tool sites the number of voting locations publicly disclosed by the county elections office as a minimum baseline. The Siting Tool’s purpose is to model the location of voting sites, not to suggest what number of voting locations best serves a community.
